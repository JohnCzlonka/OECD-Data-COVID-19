The case data is from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ and was downloaded directly into Microsoft Excel.

The by-country health data is from the OECD "Health at a Glance 2019" publication avaiable here:

https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/health-at-a-glance-2019_4dd50c09-en

It was exported from PDF as an Excel file then cleaned up in Excel.  Any missing data points were interpolated using the population mean.  Country names were edited to match the WorldoMeters data.
